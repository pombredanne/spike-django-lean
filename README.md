spike-django-lean
=================
django-lean doesn't seem to have any special features for tracking
of AJAX requests; but it makes tracking easy on the server, so you
can just define routes for this.

But there are some [jQuery plugins](stackoverflow) for this.

It seems like it uses the [sites framework](sites).
